# Course Schedule

<div class="warning">

This is a **tentative** course schedule. I will be updating it throughout the quarter. While I will try to make sure deadlines are consistent both here and on Canvas and Gradescope, the Canvas and Gradescope deadlines take precedence!

</div>

For lectures with slides I will endevour to upload and link to them in the topic column after class. However, you are **highly recommened** to take your own notes as my slides are not meant to be a comprehensive study resource, and you will be responsible for all content convered in class and the readings regardless of whether it is in the slides.
The readings column outlines the readinings or videos you are expected to complete before class. The references column will provide additional resources that can be used as reference or study material for the corresponding topic.

Acronyms for book chapters:

- **DN** : *The Design of Everyday Things*, Don Norman
- **ERP** : *Human-Computer Interaction: An Empirical Research Perspective*, I. Scott MacKenzie
- **ID** : *Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction*, Yvonne Rogers, Helen Sharp, and Jennifer Preece
