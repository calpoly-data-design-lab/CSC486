# Course Intro Survey

Welcome to CSC 486: Human Computer Interaction! I am glad you have chosen to take this course. In order to help me make this the best class I can, and in order to gauge the different levels of background and familiarity with some of the different foundational material for this course, I like to start the course with a small intro survey to learn more about y'all.  

[Here is an external link to the survey](https://forms.office.com/r/2J62CL9Q7p), please fill it out as soon as you can.
